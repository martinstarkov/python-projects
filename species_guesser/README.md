# Description

A short python program that ultilizes user feedback to improve its animal guessing ability and knowledge based on distinguishing animal characteristics. 

The user is prompted with a series of (yes/no) questions which they answer and are taken down a tree of properties such as: Is it a mammal? Does it live in the water? After which they tell the computer if its final guess was correct. 

If the user feels the computer is wrong, they are able to automatically add questions to the database and improve the computer's guessing ability.
